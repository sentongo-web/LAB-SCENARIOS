Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-03-20 11:24:32+00:00,5,"Wonderful course, excellent instructor, easily reachable, always ready to help students, he knows what he is doing, and with useful applications for the real life. Without doubt, one of the best instructors in Udemy
Antonio"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-03-21 09:51:44+00:00,5,"Diogo is truly a remarkable teacher. The pace of the course has been spot-on so far. Coming from a background of some basic/average understanding I didn't feel like the intro section was too slow and I ended up following it to jog up my memory. The problem sets and case studies are well structured and relevant for obtaining the skillsets that I will use in my current job position.

Diogo has added quite a number of interesting real life usable cases to this course which I found highly helpful! Keep up the good work!"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-03-22 22:18:18+00:00,5,"Buen curso, te ayuda a comprender las diferentes formas de hacer un análisis econométrico. Una buena opción para  comprender y aprender sobre el tema"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-03-28 18:36:55+00:00,5,"I really like the easy going approach of this course and how, from the start of each section, I am can understand where I can apply what I am learning."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-04-02 22:22:41+00:00,4.5,"Really applicable for progression in subject matter, still in the midst of course. Instructors effects shine in offer'n different paths."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-04-03 08:54:47+00:00,5,"Course is suited to my expectations. I can see the relations of Econometrics methods explained in course with real business analysis. Also, detailed explanation of R-coding is huge advantage, allowing to kill two birds with one stone.
Thanks for the course!"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-05-30 12:56:45+00:00,5,This is really one of the most useful courses about Econometrics that one can find on the web. Really good job Diogo!
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-06-11 08:19:35+00:00,5,"The intuition sets the tone and theoretical background and makes it easy to understand the application and steps. 
The videos are precise and straight to the point as an Economist I was able to grasp the coding aspect of econometrics."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-06-14 06:58:07+00:00,5,"The course is amazing, and have practical examples. Some of these techniques can directly be plugged in real world scenarios. Have tried hard before to learn differences in difference technique, however I failed to learn from internet. Diogo definitely set the context right and helped developing intuition. I'm definitely going to use some of these techniques in my day to day work. Looking forward for more such courses."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-06-27 05:09:22+00:00,5,"This course is simply the best econometrics course out there. Diogo knows what he is doing, real life case studies, no nonsense theories and complications. I highly recommend this course.
But including some math could've been great, maybe adding some formulas as papers in the next update will be GREAT. Thank you Diogo for the amazing course, waiting for more !"
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-07-05 15:25:48+00:00,5,Great walkthrough of XGBoost in Python.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-07-07 21:27:51+00:00,4,"The course was good but a bit basic in the sense that a lot of the functions/methods used are not deeply explored so modifying them to different need might be hard.
Also, some of practical cases were not that interesting, like the chicken and egg. Usage of sources of free online data would be much better (like the stocks library). And it might worth considering giving exercise to be solved alone (with solutions).
Finally, I believe that the assumptions in the heart of the techniques should be stressed more, perhaps with an example of why the analysis is wrong if the assumption fails. Repeating some of the theoretical statements during the coding can help too.

Thanks for everything!"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-07-10 16:00:56+00:00,4.5,Easy to understand and he will let you know what you need to learn if you want to go deeper.
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-07-15 01:20:24+00:00,5,"As usual Diogo makes complicated stuff simple, by usual i mean not only udemy courses but even youtube python and R tutorials. 
The sequence and division of the course is really amazing, made it easier to digest."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-07-15 09:07:00+00:00,4,Really good and accessible for everyone!
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-07-18 16:18:37+00:00,5,This is the second course I take that Diogo created and I really like how he explains concepts. What I also think is great are the bite sized videos.
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-07-23 07:46:08+00:00,5,"This is my second course with Diogo and I must say that am more than happy to have taken it. As a data analyst that is slowly getting into the world of ML I really needed an introductory course and this did the job perfectly. Diogo is well structured and the course is very easy to follow and most importantly the practical part is something that is applicable to what I am currently working on and what my professional development will be. Highly recommended!
EDIT:
Have recently rewatched some of the videos to refresh my memory on the subject because of a project I am working on at work. Helped quite a bit!"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-07-25 14:16:14+00:00,4,"It was. A nice course format, but need more details about causal inference models."
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-08-01 18:04:46+00:00,3.5,It shows a whole piple line of how to implement XGBoost. It was ok if you're a beginner :)
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-08-04 12:15:44+00:00,5,"great course, especially if you are not that good with R or python yet. If you are, you can easily skip the ""easy"" parts. Very practical & hands-on with good explanations of what is really important, without focusing much on the whole math behind the packages."
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-08-06 17:27:28+00:00,4,Thank for the course . Is short and clear . I would have expected a regression case also.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-08-17 17:24:19+00:00,5,"Great start, brilliant that he includes R and Python into one course!"
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-08-25 10:56:23+00:00,4.5,Great.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-09-01 02:11:21+00:00,5,Amazing Course!!!
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-09-29 04:43:49+00:00,4.5,Great.
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-10-05 11:52:49+00:00,5,"Amazing course - nice step by step guide for xgboost, not too much mathematical explanation, just the ones you need and easily explained. Very hands on. And I love that the videos are so short, in snack-size!"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-10-09 15:49:32+00:00,5,"Wow, such a brilliant course! Beautiful content, real examples, and amazing feedback whenever I had questions! I especially loved the set up of putting each area into context with real life examples, then discussing the model process, then doing the coding. Very nice to follow! Each video was short and sweet - perfect for doing a bit here and there, without feeling daunting that you need to commit to spending an hour on the course at a time! Following the coding was very straightforward and easy, I really appreciated the repetition of ""this is how you install a package"" because it really reinforced my learning, and was always something I'd forget. 
The only things I feel could be improved, and I'm being very picky here, were the speed of some of the videos (although you can 'speed' them up!), and perhaps adding a bit more customisation to the output visualisations"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-10-10 16:47:47+00:00,5,Great course. It's relatively easy to follow and full of practical examples.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-10-19 21:44:21+00:00,5,"I have not seen another course like this. The focus is on solving problems, not the underlying mathematics.  Dogio talks through the details in small steps from concept to working code.  He covers a lot of ground but you can always use the code to drill down further.  This course is worth it for the CausalImpact example alone but it covers much more than just that.  Covering both R and Python is a good bonus too. I am looking forward to more courses like this."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-10-22 13:08:52+00:00,5,Great course. Totally worth the money. The concepts are very well explained and the implementation of causal inference techniques covered in this course is really tough to find elsewhere on the internet.
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-10-24 14:54:04+00:00,5,"A really pleasant way to get up to speed quickly. Learning through watching and doing is certainly much better than reading a text book.  The examples are pitched from a business perspective and so are really motivating.  This course is clear, well delivered and relevant."
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-10-27 13:24:00+00:00,3,"very basic even for beginner ( R2 ?, MAE , RMSE )"
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-10-31 19:40:44+00:00,5,"Diogo thank you again for such a knowledge. i needed a refresh for linear regression with python and yet started by R. Yes you did a great job again ! 
Even having a Mathematical part will even make it helpful for students as well."
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-11-01 19:02:37+00:00,5,"This course is really great!
I was looking for a course that gives me deeper understanding in logistic regression based ML models. Unfortunately most of the courses on machine learning try to explain all models but rather on a high level. This course shows how to solve a problem end-to-end by going through the algorythm and some optimization iterations step by step.
Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning are also two important parts of this course that made it so valuable for me.

Maybe tow points for improvement: Some important topics such as evaluation metrics, when to choose which one and how to optimize the model for the chosen one would make the course even more valuable. Also I would be very interested in understanding when it is time to retrain the model and whether you would then apply again hyperparameter tuning or not.

All in all: Great course that allows quick progress for beginners like me."
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-11-02 21:28:18+00:00,5,Halfway through. Fantastic course so far!
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-11-05 11:37:43+00:00,5,The way Diogo explained the difference between life expectancy between smokers and non smokers was very clear.
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-11-06 17:57:32+00:00,5,Diogo is a great teacher. Plain and simple. This is my second course with him and I can now say that I'm a big fan of his style. He is easy to follow and explains things in a very down to earth kind of way. I was intrigued by the potential findings that we could conclude on this subject and that's what was my main driver throughout the course. Keep up the good work!
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-11-11 19:11:48+00:00,5,Really amazing course with extremely relevant content! Loved the entire setup where you could directly apply the knowledege in a realistic setup. Highly recommended!
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-11-14 14:54:14+00:00,4.5,The pace is good. Ideal for students that are not yet that comfortable with the programming languages used.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-12-12 16:38:10+00:00,5,So far the class is great for someone wanting to learn econometrics and how to apply it in R
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-12-13 21:14:48+00:00,5,It is really good. Well structured and easy to follow. Excellent course
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2020-12-15 06:21:51+00:00,4,"Good overall explanation of what the course will cover
Good to know where you cannot use regression analysis 
XG boost was explained but what is Random forest 

Python installation is before R, but in video you say “similar to R installation”

There were no steps to install R for Mac

As I had no idea about linear and logistic regression I had to view the videos multiple times and also refer to other sources to get few doubts cleared.

Over all I feel the course isn't suitable for a complete beginner like me, but for someone who knows a little bit about these topics"
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2020-12-18 20:44:57+00:00,5,Diogo is a top instructor.  I got this course as soon as I was notified of its existence. Looks good so far.  Facebook Prophet model runs nicely.  Great high level overview and hands-on examples that you can run immediately.
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2020-12-19 11:10:26+00:00,5,"Having gone through half the Time Series Forecasting Models in R course by Diogo Alves de Resende let me put on record my assessment of it so far. Main positive points: 1 – Videos / expositions are all very much to the point, clear and short (<= 10 min, not of the tiring 45 min – 1 hour sort); 2 – Thorough presentation of the applicable R code (in one instance it didn’t work for me and I wrote Diogo about it – his reply, which solved the problem, came back almost immediately, and it was on a Saturday!); 3 – Extremely practical, providing enough theory/background to understand and apply the method (Holt-Winters up to now) without going into lengthy abstruse discussions and showing how R can automatically handle issues so as to avoid tiresome and error-prone coding. No negative points of any relevance. I certainly look forward to the second half of the course confident it will be very instructive and useful. Very good job, Diogo! – Vernon Kohl, São Paulo, Brazil"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-12-21 18:38:35+00:00,4,quite interesting. But the speaker should explain everything a bite better. He tends to rumbles on the same issue without considering that the issue treated in the course is quite difficult to understand.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-12-23 09:16:22+00:00,5,"Excellent coverage, delivery and clear and direct direction to the point. I like the way of organizing your training thoughts  from uses,  intuition and tutorial. This allows learners to trace the purposes, benefits and know how of each method.  Immediate response is another amazing pillar with Diago courses. Congratulation!"
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2020-12-29 09:46:40+00:00,4.5,"Haven't completed the course yet. However, explanations are pretty well in the Propensity score matching part. Seems more in less!
Well done, Diogo!"
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2020-12-29 10:10:33+00:00,5,A well thought-through course that is perfectly challenging for someone who has some idea on the subject and wants to further their knowledge. This was a recommendation from a colleague from work and I must say for a good reason. Keep up the good work!
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2020-12-29 21:13:07+00:00,5,Great course! Thanks! Looking for something like this for so long in Russian educational platforms. Nothing =( Was forced to learn English. Didn't regret this choice
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2020-12-30 12:58:21+00:00,5,Great course to really get your hands dirty and very easy to listen to! Also I had a sligt issue installing R and had an imediate response from Diogo!!!
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2021-01-01 16:24:43+00:00,5,"I have gone through most of this course. Being a student of economics myself and as someone learning analytics, this course not only helped me grasp the concepts of Regression, but also helped me connect the dots between my classroom topics and practical application."
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2021-01-04 17:50:35+00:00,4.5,yes love it
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2021-01-06 15:13:12+00:00,5,Excellent course. The instructor walks you through each example with lots of details. If you are looking to learn R or Python as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist this is a great course.

Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2021-01-23 08:42:56+00:00,5,Great course again! Not only did I learn about regressions but also about common business problems such as pricing and churning. Its great to see how the theory is applied to a real problem and how to interpret the results in a way it can but used for actions!
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2021-01-26 10:46:44+00:00,5,The course was really useful in breaking down how xgboost function works. On top of that Diogo was swift in his response to my query around regression examples going out of his way to offer the additional examples. Would recommend to anyone interested in learning xgboost.
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-01-27 21:50:13+00:00,5,"Diogo is an exceptional trainer. The course is explained in details and with great examples to practice. Moreover, he worked based on the feedback from his students and added valuable information such as scientific papers to encourage us to keep learning. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to deepen the knowledge in Econometrics and R."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2021-02-12 09:37:32+00:00,1,Information is under-explained and messy.
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-02-15 14:42:32+00:00,5,Great teaching style. Very easy to follow!
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2021-02-18 00:18:14+00:00,5,"Diogo is an excellent instructor. He provides great examples and explains everything in detail, in a way that is so easy to understand. I recommend this course to anyone who has some Statistics knowledge and wish to depend the knowledge in R and Python."
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-02-24 18:06:10+00:00,5,"Great Intructor, he is very organized. The content is presented with cases. This is my second course, and I will probably buy new courses if he offers in the future."

It is easy to follow and i would say even quite entertaining! Moreover, you can easily adapt codes to your own data set. Diogo is very helpfull and quick to respond. And what i really liked that Diago not only shows the codes, but also explains each line, plus refreshes your knowledge of econometrics! Looking forwards to other Diogo's courses! Many thanks for this one!"
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-03-01 03:57:41+00:00,5,One of the most useful classes I've encountered on Udemy.
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-03-15 17:44:42+00:00,5,"The instructor is tremendously clear and succinct. I did this course after an elementary one on Time Series Analysis because I had no prior knowledge on the topic, and it worked pretty well for me. I definitely recommend this course if you wanna become familiar with time series forecasting."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2021-03-23 19:49:10+00:00,5,"The trainer is amazing person. Not only he teaches well, but afterwards he is always available to reply to any query one might have. Even follow up queries are patiently answered. Continue the good work, Diogo!!"
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-03-30 09:53:26+00:00,5,"So far, I skimmed through the first chapters of Diogo’s class and once again I’m impressed by how clear and precise he is able to explain complex subject matter. Great content, great teacher. Can only recommend"
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-03-31 15:25:42+00:00,5,"I ran through the attack and intro of all sections. I can say all concepts are well taught and tell when and why it is used . 
The programming parts are well structured and easy to follow, it is the instructor's way. Can be seen in his YouTube channel as well.

The instructor breaks complicated topics into pieces, which make it possible to build complex models for tasks in work.

Another great course (Y)"
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-04-10 18:16:39+00:00,5,I had no prior knowledge of the matter. But Diogo explained all contents etremely clear and as always has great examples that really help you to understand what is happening. Highly recommended!
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2021-04-12 15:02:59+00:00,3.5,"After implementing many random forest models, I searched new and potentially better methods and I found this course.This course gives you a very good start if you familiar with the basics of machine learning and want to learn the basics of XGboost.
Some ideas and recommendations about setting the ideal or rule of thumb values of hyperparameters would be appreciated.
The results interpretation part was very useful to me.
Thank you for the course!


Do you have any information whether iml package in R works with xgboost models? I created partial dependence plots for randomforest models but i am not sure how to do it with xgboost."
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2021-04-13 23:26:46+00:00,5,Brilliant ! The parameters tuning part is so replicable and really well explained. It gives some sense to all the metrics we see on most ML models.
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-04-15 10:19:55+00:00,5,"Got into this with little to no expectations but Diogo managed to get me interested and involved. Great pace, great level of detail. Didn't have many ""Wait what?"" moments which is good. I'm half way through the course now and will update my rating if I have any complaints but so far so good! Keep up the good work!"
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-04-18 12:37:47+00:00,5,One of the most detailed courses on Data Mining I went through so far on Udemy!
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2021-04-20 10:45:39+00:00,4.5,Amazing and interesting course. I could finish the course in 2 days. It is very useful course for beginners. Amazing mentor. Loved the way of teaching. Thank you Diogo for this course.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2021-05-10 10:40:58+00:00,5,"I really enjoyed this course and would highly recommend it!
It taught me a lot of techniques that will definitely enhance my everyday work.
Course is very well structured with a lot of real life case studies and practical part covered in both Python and R. Also, Diogo is an amazing teacher. His explanations are very clear and straight to the point, which makes it easy to follow even if you’re an absolute beginner. He provides enough theory to really understand each concept without overcomplicating it with unnecessary details. 
Great job!"
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-05-10 17:51:34+00:00,5,"This is the second Diogo’s course that I’ve done and, again, he managed to impress me with the quality of the content. Course covers a lot of exciting data mining techniques with an interesting examples. Explanations are detailed, but Diogo makes it easy to follow. Additionally, he provides cool challenges and a lot of material to further investigate the topics. Highly recommended!"
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2021-05-18 12:47:04+00:00,5,Exceed my expectations! The topics are challenging but the teacher created an atmosphere where difficult concepts are being explained thoroughly using the laymen's language.
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2021-05-18 20:46:57+00:00,5,Fantastic course!
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2021-05-25 04:04:50+00:00,4.5,"Made it very easy to follow and was direct to the point. However, I wish he would go a bit more in depth in the exercise on how to interpret the results and what we want the outcomes to be and how they make sense based on pervious steps."
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2021-05-30 20:02:16+00:00,3.5,"Step by step introductory course on the basics of linear regression using Python, but I really wished it would go deeper or with more examples than the mere basics - specially for people already used to Linear Regression models in other tools."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2021-06-02 13:51:45+00:00,4,"Much better course than the regression for business one. To use famous papers as examples is a great idea. Still, much to be improved. Things are still missing, namely in depth summaries for students not used to econometrics, restrictions on how one should use each model  for and when they shouldn't. I would also end every section with an in depth view of the output of the model and the interpretation / operational or public policy conclusions that the decision maker should make - Something easy when using economics papers as guidelines. And I wouldn't do it directly from the Spyder screen, but on PPT, like the intro sections. Would recommend the professor to see the 365 course on Credit models, to see how he can explain both model characteristics, limitations and outputs easily without hurting the flow. 

Would support a second course on intermediate/advanced Econometrics on Python. There is barely any courses for trained economists coming from R or Stata who need to use Python, but I do believe the professor is able to increase the depth by adding new models, examples and case studies in the future."

Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2021-06-10 13:35:40+00:00,5,"The course was filled with various forecasting models and showed how to use them!  The only suggestion would be to add more depth on the parameters/features that a forecaster might focus on to tweak the model.  Fortunately, he dives into that - just wanted a bit more depth.  This course was amazing!  Thank you!"
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2021-06-10 19:29:28+00:00,5,"I have taken couple of courses by this instructor - Econometrics, and Time series (this course). It is amazing and refreshing to see how he manages to convey the essence of the topic and its practical implementation in programming, without making the lectures too long. 
And I have liked that he is always quick to resolve  queries and doubts on lectures. 
Continue the good work!! You make learning interesting."

Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-07-08 20:46:03+00:00,5,"This course was an absolute life saver. I have used numerous ML processes in Python but only to produce categorical or binary results. Suddenly I found myself needing to apply ML to time series data and all my existing models simply weren't designed to handle this kind of task.

Then I found this course and within 24 hours I was applying several of the models to real world business problems and generating immediate results. 

The information provided in this course is essential tool to any analytics toolkit and I highly recommend it!

5 Stars all day!"

Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-07-27 10:14:33+00:00,3.5,"The course helped me to extend my knowledge about time series forecasting. It has a good diversity of content and the theory is well explained.
In a few points I thing the course could be improved:
- I find that the definition of multiplicative and additive seasonality is a bit unclear. The advise seems to find it out by trial and error and define your choice depending on the final model output, if I got it right. Well, I wish to be possible to find out about the type of seasonality before running the model.
- All that copy-paste procedure causes some disorientation. I suggest you use a script template only for the part of loading and pre-processing the data, and the exporting part in the end. It is good practice to re-write the code of the rest of the script (i.e. the modelling and model training part). I think it helps with learning, and after all, they are just 5 models. 
- In the exercise statement of Neural Networks, when you ask for forecasting 4 periods, I thought you where talking about the period of a cycle (i.e. the season). So I have forecasted 16 quarters, since each cyclic period have 4 quarters. oss. to measure the period I've decomposed the time series and looked at the seasonal pattern.
Thanks for the course."

I will for sure check out your other courses and recommend it to anyone who is intrested in forecasting!
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2021-11-11 06:40:08+00:00,3.5,If it is more clear with covering all ways that we can perform a model then it will be good and useful.
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-11-17 02:52:53+00:00,3.5,"Great explanations, very clear and concise. Probably could have improved more on the explanation for the parameters of each model, how they work,  and how to optimize them. I also got confused with some of the scripting, would have preferred to have the script at the beginning of each section so we can code along. Thank you."

Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2021-12-27 22:38:36+00:00,5,"Coming from under two years of forecasting with a start-up, we've only used the super basic models. Being able to understand five different models in a short time using R, I feel that using what I've learned from this course can help me forecast inventory levels in many different ways (along with the current way I'm doing forecasting), throwing everything into an ensemble and see how accurate the forecast would be."
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2021-12-28 22:05:04+00:00,4.5,"Excellent course for business applications in Python. That was main reason I have choosen it and I was very satisfied. My suggestion to the author is to improve part when one is interpreting the results. Not the SHAP part, this was very well explained, but the previous ones. Just spend some more time explaining meaning of the results. I believe it will increase value of knowledge you deliver."

Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2022-01-30 13:40:26+00:00,3.5,"Мне кажется, что слишком много времени уделено базовым вещам. Хотелось бы, чтоб в модуле озвучивалось, например, такое: ""Если вы знакомы с google colab, можете смело переходить к следующему модулю"""
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2022-01-31 18:43:02+00:00,5,"Outstanding course, very fast paced and really focused on applications. And the instructor is very kind and he answer the question really quickly. The only thing that I missed is more in depth theory, but I don't believe that's the course's purpose, therefore another course with more of it would be welcomed."
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2022-02-02 20:18:15+00:00,5,"The course is pretty straighforward and goes straight to the point. You code beside the tutor and in addition the code is well structured and delivered for your fast personal use.

Some constructive comments would be that the course should use bad/dirty data as in a real life case scenario, so we could learn how to clean it in a more detailed way.

However as in my case, if you have any questions, the tutor himself makes a great job at answering them and even goes a little further and delivers an example of his answer. 

Great course and would totally recommend!"
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2022-02-07 11:17:49+00:00,5,I really like the course and the simple way of explanations with good examples. I want to write my master thesis about this topic and the course is a great way to start and improve my understanding

Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2022-09-15 03:40:38+00:00,3.5,"Overall, a solid course to build a basic foundation on different forecasting models. The pacing was good and the code was easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this topic, but in my opinion, there could be some improvements.

1) At the end of every section, before the exercise, the models are evaluated on the same data set, while the results vary, they are not great. It would be much more helpful if there was some sort of revision or tweaks made to the model to see how it could be improved rather than just saying ""it looks better"" or ""it is not so great"". For example, the Prophet + XGBoost results were worse than the regular Prophet results, but no explanation or discussion was made about it. Felt incomplete.
2) There is a lot of wasted time opening and copying/pasting the same scripts over and over again for every kind of model."
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2022-09-15 13:11:45+00:00,5,I like the Animation

I understand the templates as well and they will be very helpful. I would've liked to learn as well how to do Forecast models for different SKUs (different y variables) with the same code sheet, because many people work on doing many different product forecasts. Also, I would've liked to know if the models work with missing data, with zeros, with some days (eg. sundays) having 0 sales, etc. In general, I liked it very much and learned a lot! Loved how Diogo still answers questions even after a year of the publishing of this course."

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2022-10-26 11:23:57+00:00,5,"I really love this so far. The most important thing with courses, aside from the content, is the instructor delivering it. Diogo Alves de Resende does a fantastic job. The information is presented in a relaxed yet detailed way that makes it easy to learn. The instructor includes humor at points where you don't expect it. 5/5 for this course from me."
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2022-10-26 11:36:57+00:00,5,"This is one of the best courses on learning various forecasting models in python

Diogo (instructor) is extremely clear in the course content, the templates provided as spot on and most importantly, Diogo is always quick to answer any questions coming from the trainees. 

Thanks so much for this knowledge, kudos to Diogo and the team!"
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2022-10-28 01:22:03+00:00,5,The course so far is excellent; I am to follow along with the lessons and the course setup is not complicated. Would recommend to a friend.

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2022-11-02 00:13:55+00:00,5,"I believe this will be a good match. I came from Andrei's Complete Python 2022 course, and it looks as though his Data Science and Machine Learning chapters at the end will dovetail nicely with this new course. I firmly believe ZTM has improved in  suggesting courses that are not only integral to my interests but also logical next steps along my learning path."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2022-11-02 09:30:11+00:00,3,"I like the contents and topics covered in this course. It is very unique from others stat/data science course which focusing more on econometrics model. I also like how the courses was broken-down into many bit-size short videos which we can follow easily step-by-step. 
Perhaps if we can have consistent case study intuition (explanation) and R tutorial example. Using different example for each models make the course contents look more like project / coding showcase instead of a structured course. 
Other things that might be improved would be using train-test/validate approach to compare AUC/ Sensitivity or MAE/MAPE instead of predict everything then compare with everything in original dataset. 
Overall, it is very useful content and it definitely improve my knowledge. Thanks."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2022-11-02 19:07:15+00:00,4,This is introductory course. The instructor have a good and clear explanation. In my opinion it's a good option for those who never seen this subject before.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2022-11-04 04:17:55+00:00,5,"I took the Python course of Andrei before and, since then, have become a ZTM fan! I have no doubt that under the ZTM every course is as professional and well made as it could be! Although I have to admit that some concepts seem very advanced to me and I have to look for additional explanations on youtube or elsewhere on the internet to better understand them. I have no prior experience in statistics. Ideally, if the course had animated sections with extremely clear visualization of the concepts, it usually work for me to understand abstract concepts better. ( I'm writing this review at the 20% course completion. )"

1 thing I do not agree with is that the recall is very impoverish i.e. 0.48. I think better feature selection should be done.. Dropping the threshold from 0.5 to 0.05 is not an ideal scenario as it can increase a lot of cost to the business by producing too many false Positives."

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-04-11 01:13:12+00:00,4,"This instructor is one of the best on Udemy.  I took a similar class prior to this one and it was not as engaging.  A little more detail, especially in the Prophet section explaining more what the results mean would really help.  Great course though!"
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-04-11 23:26:55+00:00,2,"it does not teach anything, just memorizing you some functions with 0 explaining and giving the easiest examples you might see in your life."
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-04-13 04:04:00+00:00,5,"Many thanks, Diogo and Udemy for a great course! This will hopefully give people like me a strong basic foundation to advance our skills in forecasting through Python.

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-04-27 16:04:42+00:00,5,Súper
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2023-05-01 06:21:31+00:00,3,"I liked the course, but it is more towards spoonfeeding and dictation side, rather than towards learning, this could have been much better, had we been using TSM Analysis to solve business problems, interpreting data and then applying it to results. Overall, i learned a lot, but it could have been even more insightful"

Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2023-06-07 18:15:31+00:00,5,He is engaging and easy to follow. He explains the concepts in a very simple terms/language to understand.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2023-06-08 01:46:34+00:00,5,"I was looking for more explanation about what econometrics is and the math behind it. For instance, when the instructor says that a given number means that something is a good match, I don't understand why (other than p-values). The course has taught me R Studio, which is something I wanted to learn so it was certainly worth my time. But, it didn't teach what I was looking for this class."
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-06-08 09:06:44+00:00,5,"Instructor Diogo was able to break it down in a way that a beginner can understand, despite time series forecasting is a normally challenging ML concept. He has good communication skills and always made sure to go as far as explaining each parameter.

His Discord server is also really useful as you can clarify any doubts you have on time series forecasting, and he has helped me a ton. Would really recommend you to grab this course as it is still, considering that Diogo also looks out to update it with new sections for recent techniques in TS forecasting."
Statistics for Business Analytics: Data Analysis with Excel,2023-06-08 12:05:47+00:00,4,I love the topics covered so far. I am trying to understand the rudimentary of data analysis.
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2023-06-11 15:50:07+00:00,3.5,The course was very helpful. I have a feedback. The Logistic Regression section does not include log of odds explanation.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-06-12 05:42:05+00:00,5,"It was really fun this far. The examples and explanations are easy to understand. I think this gives me a good foundation to dig deeper on my own after I have finished the course. But for now, I do feel like I have the first tools I need to play around in some datasets on my own and apply what I learnt."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-06-19 13:43:26+00:00,5,"Informative, engaging and practical."

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-06-25 12:27:54+00:00,3,Not in-depth explanation on data analysis for new students
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-06-28 06:34:11+00:00,5,This is very nice course to learn more new things in analytics
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-07-04 07:55:26+00:00,5,"It is clear, concise and easy to understand."
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2023-07-05 17:38:47+00:00,3.5,This course is valuable but also very drawn out which makes focusing on some of the heavier content a challenge. Fitting it in around other workflow is nearly impossible.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-07-05 17:59:42+00:00,5,Probably the best python statistical course I've ever taken. Each learning unit built a python model that you can use in your job as a data analyst. The challenges were rigorous but they were relevant and applicable to the business use case that you get on the job.  And the best part about the course was that the instructor was always there to help you code -  by patiently going over and explaining the code - line by line.  I highly recommend the course.
Statistics for Business Analytics: Data Analysis with Excel,2023-07-08 03:50:27+00:00,5,"Still, the course material is always explained clearly."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2023-07-09 10:08:29+00:00,1,not getting much. i am new to R studio so finding difficulty in coding
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-07-09 16:08:41+00:00,3,"Quite poor content, esp in RFM Segmentation part.
Since I am just a Junior DA, with just few searches via Google, we can have a much better version one. I think that the statistical part of the course is the only reason keep me not requesting a refund."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-07-11 16:49:48+00:00,5,Real pleasure to learn amazing things
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-07-13 13:29:51+00:00,4.5,"Very easy to understand and follow , great job by the trainer !"
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-07-14 14:34:56+00:00,1,"First of all the approach on subjects is way too basic, explaining near to non theoretical reasons of why things are the way they are. Also, up to now NON of the regression problems have done a good job, so you cant really asses how good a method is. 
If you are looking for a very basic course without mayor information about why things happen this might work for you."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-07-18 05:43:04+00:00,4,good
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-07-18 05:45:35+00:00,5,Good!!!

Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2023-07-22 08:25:15+00:00,5,"The course is very well organized, easy to understand and there are many useful resources for the course or for further study. 

However, I would have liked to have seen a more in-depth ""final"" application case, especially in terms of interpretations and subsequent choices made in relation to the basic objective.

Overall: I highly recommend this very interesting and well-designed course to anyone who wants to know how to gain new and valuable business insights."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-07-24 05:58:50+00:00,5,Yes it totally match with our industry. Amazing example
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-07-24 08:25:23+00:00,3.5,"Hi Diego, I am enjoying your course so far, as I can see you brought in your professional expertise and applied methods into the course, which is of practical importance, no doubt. The visuals are great, and your Python coding is fun and approachable. However, at moments I caught myself being a bit frustrated because the theoretical and statistical underpinning of the course is very limited. So to be able to properly understand these models I was forced to constantly switch between your course and university textbooks in econometrics and time series, even though I took intro stats and econometrics in college. Given that I need this for work and I believe other students need that too, it is difficult to intuitively apply methods in the real-world setting while equipped with a rudimentary grasp of statistics behind them. I think intuition is built in part through studying theory.  So to make this a one-stop-shop, the course would greatly benefit from at least some math and stats to describe the concepts behind the models. I understand you refrained from that approach as you probably wanted to open this topic to non-math professionals, and that makes sense to a degree, but I think you ought to make more effort toward striking the right balance between theory and practice.  Of course, this is my personal view, based on my background and needs, and I am sure that other folks with different objectives and backgrounds can get a lot of value from the course.  I would still recommend the course to everyone. Descent job Diego, keep it up!"
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-07-24 21:20:03+00:00,3,"Creo que el curso podría tomar en cuenta más temáticas importantes. Como ejemplos de variables importantes a tomar en cuenta. También podría explicar qué hacer  en diversas situacciones.  Como qué hacer cuando quieres predecir la venta de distintos productos, o qué tomar en cuenta si quieres hacer predicciones a más largo plaza y no solo 31 días"
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2023-07-25 02:30:06+00:00,5,Refresh my econometrics and forecasting skills.

Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-10-02 16:18:18+00:00,5,This course has certainly given to me knowledge analytics and finance
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2023-10-04 15:17:47+00:00,4.5,"Brilliant introduction to XGBoost. Very clear and provides a great example. Only thing I would say the content is broken into way too many videos and would be slightly easier to follow if there were fewer, longer videos."
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-07 22:19:34+00:00,5,"Świetny prowadzący, dużo przykładów praktycznego zastosowania. Bardzo dobry kurs"
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-11 10:19:38+00:00,4.5,"Firstly, thank you for creating this course. I enjoyed it and appreciate all the effort that you put into it. This course provides a great overview of foundational statistics and more advanced techniques to give an individual the confidence to pursue a career in this field. What sets Diogo's teaching apart is his structured approach - each lecture builds upon the previous one - and this helps you to feel confident in applying what you have learned. I would strongly advise fellow learners to approach this course with patience, resisting the urge to rush through it, as I've done with previous courses. Taking the time to absorb the content pays off in the long run."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2023-10-12 15:10:02+00:00,4,"Very interesting, I'm learning to code into R."
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2023-10-13 15:11:00+00:00,4,Good. Can't wait to get to real content on how to do it.
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-10-16 11:12:31+00:00,5,Great
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-10-17 03:24:19+00:00,2.5,Very poor in the many instances where the instructor would use Excel examples on a topic. These were very distracting as he would show the mouse moving around. I could have explained many of the concepts in this class in a better way for the student to follow and learn.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-17 14:48:14+00:00,3,"It was good however my main problem with this course is you are supposed to teach us from the basic, in the real world, clients would want to visualize our finding. moreover , most the time we jus reach the results but i didnt understand what we gained from it the finishing touch for each project was poor. maybe insert more videos that explain the finishing  better similar to a real world scenario.  Nonetheless i learned a lot from the core parts so thank you for the ZTM team and Diogo for their efforts."
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2023-10-17 18:27:03+00:00,3.5,I am enjoying the class and the information being presented
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-10-17 19:09:28+00:00,4,The course is great
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-22 12:42:44+00:00,4.5,"The goods: the concise format, the examples are relevant, most of the codes runs (I run it locally with VS Code), instructor is responsive.

The not-so-good: typos and the delivery is not so engaging."
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-10-22 15:33:42+00:00,4,"I really like the level of depth used in the course. Excels on the practical part. Not too deep that you get lost in the minutiae, but still gives you a good context of where the ideas come from. That said, it's not a course for absolute beginners in Python and data science. To enjoy the benefits of the course and not get stuck on the technical aspects of it, better have a good grasp of Pandas/numpy/ML basics."
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-22 21:12:14+00:00,4,Definitely a good course in python being applied to analytics. First half of the course is the best part.
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-10-23 12:55:45+00:00,5,"This was a very interesting course, full of super useful concepts and from the programing perspective for those who do not know how to use Python, easy to follow and understand.
Thanks for all the effort you put on creating it Diogo! 100% recommended!"
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2023-10-26 17:12:42+00:00,4,It's all been introductory so far but Diogo is thorough and easy to follow. The resources look great and I have connected with him on LinkedIn and Facebook.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-27 17:48:53+00:00,4,I thought that coding is the most difficult thing in this world. But this course has made me have the different perspective. I am really enjoying it.
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2023-10-27 20:56:49+00:00,4.5,"Yes, the course was enlightening."
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-10-28 18:33:04+00:00,5,"So far,I am really enjoying and following the course. I really like that there is a community to help each other."
XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R,2023-10-28 21:41:49+00:00,5,Excelent course!
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2023-11-01 15:19:21+00:00,5,excellent
Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R,2023-11-06 14:43:19+00:00,3,"Es un buen curso para conocer conceptos básicos y comenzar a entrar en el mundo del Forecasting, sobre todo porque abarca muchos temas actuales. Como es de esperarse, los ejemplos son sencillos y no se aborda mucho detalle de la interpretación de los todos los resultados."
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-11-08 17:02:11+00:00,1,"Not a good course :
1- some python code are not up to date and doesn't work.
2- the course doesn't add any value compare to the simple reading of either wikipedia article or documentation of python module used. Considered this course as a audio version of those.
3- instructor doesn't really know python and code could easily be improved
4- exercices don't add anything to learning. It's just an opportunity to writte the exact same code you wrote in the theoric part.
5- course info say it's about 15 hours but the course is slowed down (must go to 1.5x speed to have a normal speaking person)
6- video are overly cut to make increase the number of videos but most of them are about 1 min long

If I know that there was not other link with Zero To Mastery but the name, I'd never bought this course."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-11-09 06:43:25+00:00,4.5,good

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-11-16 13:12:13+00:00,3.5,The information provided was good and easy to follow along. I would recommend to anyone interested in the topics as a complete beginner. I was anticipating more intermediate level  approach to the case studies. only wished the case studies were more fleshed out in an end to end way that would be presented to an employer or added to a portfolio . I would take another course from Diego and he responds in Q&A which is appreciated
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-11-17 04:16:01+00:00,5,Relatively Short but very complete. The instructor is very engaging with the students to resolve issues.
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-11-21 08:03:47+00:00,5,good
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-11-21 16:51:42+00:00,5,Your clarity of mind and speech is visible in your training.

Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2023-11-27 18:29:19+00:00,1,"Lack of details, apparently lector knows nothing about econometric"
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-11-28 20:12:54+00:00,5,"Excellent Course-the best of a half dozen time-series/forecasting classes I've taken on Udemy. Facebook Prophet, and the combination with XGBoost especially stand out. I hope Diogo does another course."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-12-01 14:13:45+00:00,4,"Yes, the study is a good match for me"
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-12-03 06:17:25+00:00,5,One of the best courses I've taken on Udemy and I've taken several.

Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-12-14 14:48:11+00:00,5,A very good introduction course. Recommended.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2023-12-14 17:26:04+00:00,5,very good
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2023-12-15 15:26:14+00:00,5,"diogo combines humour with visuals, thought provoking thought experiments, and clear conceptual explanations. from someone who used to be intimidated by data analytics, his course has gotten me really interested and i can't wait to learn more!"
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-12-16 19:54:06+00:00,2,"The teacher seems nice, but I think this course has major issues that should be addressed: 1. He's not a very good Python programmer. It is visible he carries a lot of bad practices from R, doesn't know PEP8, and doesn't have advanced programming skills (he repeats a lot of code instead of using functions or classes). 2. He's not a very good ML practitioner, either. His models have poor performance (the best forecasting model has +30% MAPE... and he chose that example data...), and he doesn't know very well how to address the poor performance. Most of the times he just acts like there's nothing to be done. For example, his Prophet+XGBoost model performs worse than the Prophet model by itself, and this is not addressed in the lesson. Why?"
Data Mining for Business Analytics & Data Analysis in Python,2023-12-19 15:59:58+00:00,5,"The course provided a comprehensive overview of the subject matter, covering key concepts in a well-structured manner. The instructor's engaging teaching style, coupled with diverse resources like interactive lectures and practical assignments, made the learning experience enjoyable. However, clearer communication regarding assignment deadlines could enhance the experience. The availability of supplementary materials was beneficial for deeper understanding. Overall, while there are areas for improvement, the course offered valuable insights and knowledge that I would recommend to others seeking a solid foundation in this field."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2023-12-19 19:51:54+00:00,2.5,"regarding the exercise I hoped to be more clear , and giving real life examples ."
Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2023-12-27 06:38:47+00:00,1,More irrelevant at the beginning of the course. We dont have time to waste just like that
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2023-12-29 05:10:29+00:00,4,So far so good!
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2023-12-30 13:22:28+00:00,5,Enriching & valuable information is being provided in a simplistic manner

Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-01-09 14:30:58+00:00,2,The title of the course is misleading. It turned out to be about investment decision making. I was expecting mor info on the fundamentals of decision making and problem solving.
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2024-01-17 20:32:00+00:00,4,It's alot to digest.
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-01-25 21:40:20+00:00,4.5,yes it is....

Forecasting Models and Time Series for Business in Python,2024-02-13 05:58:27+00:00,5,good
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2024-02-13 14:16:01+00:00,3.5,Section 4: too many examples with different subjects. May be will be stay on one topic and don't jump from one to another.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2024-02-15 11:21:12+00:00,5,The course is great because it conveys concepts about statistics concisely and simply.
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2024-02-16 22:03:31+00:00,4.5,"Great course to learn about econometrics and causal inference with interesting real life examples. Instructor did a good job explaining concepts supplemented with live coding. It is rare to combine R and Python, but  causal implementation available in R made me to learn R and experiment with it. Thanks to the enthusiastic instructor!"
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2024-02-18 11:36:15+00:00,4,Great Course.

Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2024-02-27 22:09:16+00:00,3.5,It got a little repetitive in the beginning but in the end it got better I especially enjoyed the Facebook Prophet section.
Business Data Analytics & Intelligence with Python,2024-02-29 15:47:48+00:00,5,"great articulation
straight to the point
immediate exercise after each knowledge point
deep voice pleasant to hear
clear structure with ease to difficulty gradation"
Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders,2024-03-01 15:53:15+00:00,3.5,"1. Continuous variables are usually defined as variables which can take an infinite number of values within a specific range. Each value can be infinitesimally small. Discrete variables can only take integer or natural number values. So number of people is a discrete variable, because you can't have a small fraction of a person.
2. It's not clear why standard deviation was needed in the case study, because the actual values and delta in revenues, profit, etc. could easily be calculated."
Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python,2024-03-04 12:03:59+00:00,1,very poor content and worst dataset ever
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-03-04 19:44:47+00:00,3.5,"not a good match for  me due to current government job without profitable earnings, marketing requirements."
Regression Analysis for Business Managers in Python and R,2024-03-05 05:40:08+00:00,1,I was not looking for this video
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-03-08 08:49:56+00:00,5,This is helpful in making decision and what to consider in solving a problem.
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-03-09 18:40:23+00:00,4.5,Its just amazing and looking forward for more such amazing courses.
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-03-11 17:13:07+00:00,4,"Great course, I believe most of us unconsciously have applied some theory & methods explained in this course without knowing. Scientific background studies could help us  to understand more. Only one thing, i didnt expect there is a specific section where we need to learn investment or financial stuff, caught me off guard at first, however i took it as a side-knowledge to shape my way of thinking."
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-03-12 14:13:20+00:00,4.5,Useful training.
Decision Making with Problem Solving & Critical Thinking,2024-03-12 18:34:04+00:00,2,I think it needs to provide opportunities to practice using the formula.
